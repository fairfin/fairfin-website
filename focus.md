### Integration of Local and International students

Some years ago the study courses DKE and DE have become very popular with international students. This is also heavily due to the fact that those courses are offered in English language. <br />
Today we see many problems associated with the faculties utter unpreparedness in regards to having international students. There has been some good work, but there's still a long way to go.  <br /> 
Last semester the percentage of international students in our faculty was over 37% (593 students), while for the current summer term there are 343 international students applying for a course.  <br /> 
Of course not all of the international students are non-german-speaking - but visibly a big part of the faculty consists of such students. When we refer to "international" students in later instances of this document, we generally address those students, who came here to absolve their studies in the English language. <br /> 
These students are separated from german-speaking students in many ways. On a social level we observe two nearly completely separate groups of students which don't really interact with one another. Academically there are still many problems for international students at our faculty. Up until now there wasn't even a possibility of electing international students into the student council. <br /> 
In the same way as the faculty FaRaFIN has been struggling with this evolution. There has been some good intentioned work towards bettering the situation, yet still international students often don't feel represented or aided by FaRaFIN. <br /> 
We aim to change this and transform our faculty into a truly inclusive and multicultural place.

### Anti discrimination work

We want to highlight and focus different sides of discrimination. In making discriminative behaviour visible we want to create awareness among people. In our opinion this is the first step to better inclusiveness. <br /> 
With this goal in mind members of our group have founded FaRaFINs awareness group this January and are currently in the process of building this group.

### Opening up FaRaFIN for political work

In the year 2009 FaRaFIN has adopted a stance not to do political work, except for (in extreme cases) academic policies.  <br /> 
Not only does this mean FaRaFIN won't do any projects which could be deemed political in any way (which is difficult if you consider everything to be in some way political) - but it also doesn't fund or advertise anything in that regard.  <br /> 
Lately this rule has loosened a bit, but, as demonstrated by the refusal to advertise an event on free social media, this is more due to not having questioned if a event is political or not.  <br /> 
These days we have to face a lot of important political topics which can have a huge impact on our lives today and in the future. Currently there are Students demonstrating each Friday for the sake of our climate at the Fridays for future demonstartions. We want to support this cause as a student council. <br /> 
Again and again right-wing and racist demonstrations are called for. Especially with regard to our international fellow students, we want to stand up for tolerance and openness to the world. Therefore we want to take a very clear stand against racism and discrimination.  <br /> 
Especially for computer science students internet policy is very interesting since we are often regarded as experts for digital topics. With regard to topics like the discussion about article 13 (and others) we want to inform and position ourselves more. 

### Promote ethical thinking amongst our students

Computer science is often refrerred to as the job of the future. This is due to the ever-increasing digitalisation and nowadays computer scientists are needed in almost every field of work. As many of us will work with personal and sensitive data in the future a basic ethical thinking is crucial. Therefore we want to promote ethnical and critical thinking amongst the students, especially concerning topics like military, repression, cencorship and privacy. Thus the students should become aware of their own ethical responsibility.

### Improve the study situation of all students

With regard to the study situation, we have various points in mind that could be improved. As we have observed over the last few semesters how overcrowded some public laboratories are, we believe that more faculty rooms should be made accessible to students. This also refers to the fact that some of the conference rooms should be bookable by students via the farafin (analogous to R412). <br /> 
We are also striving for a simplified and unified registration procedure for courses. In this context we also want to make the registration fairer, because especially new students often have problems to still find free places in some courses. <br />
As stressful as the registration for courses at the beginning of the semester is the examination phase at the end of the semester. The majority of examinations are often held in the first weeks of the examination phase, which makes it considerably more difficult for students to prepare well for them. That is why we want to work towards a better distribution of examination dates throughout the entire examination phase. <br />
During the last semesters fewer and fewer students enrolled in the computational visualistics course. This applies to both the bachelor's and master's degrees. We also observed that the remaining areas of specialization are underrepresented in comparison to medicine. In our opinion this points out that there is some room for improvements regarding this course.

### Fundamental reform and opening of FaRaFIN 
We believe that there are some grievances and a general toxic culture in FaRaFIN at the moment. This often has a negative effect on the mood and tone in FaRaFIN which is also noticed by outside observers. More and more students feel uncomfortable turning to the FaRaFIN for help.<br />
In addition, many students do not feel represented by the current FaRaFIN, since e.g. no international student is an elected member. This also means that many of the decisions are made without involving a huge part of the student body.<br /> 
We think it would be a good solution to open up the FaRaFIN more. Students who do not want to join FaRaFIN but are nevertheless interested in a certain topic can get more involved. This also unburdens the members of FaRaFIN. In addition, FaRaFIN will be more open and have more connection to the student body.
