## Integration of Local and International students

Some years ago the study courses DKE and DE have become very popular with international students. This is also heavily due to the fact that those courses are offered in English language.
Today we see many problems associated with the faculties utter unpreparedness in regards to having international students. There has been some good work, but there's still a long way to go.
Last semester the percentage of international students in our faculty was over 37% (593 students), while for the current summer term there are 343 international students applying for a course.
Of course not all of the international students are non-german-speaking - but visibly a big part of the faculty consists of such students. When we refer to "international" students in later instances of this document, we generally address those students, who came here to absolve their studies in the English language.
These students are separated from german-speaking students in many ways. On a social level we observe two nearly completely separate groups of students which don't really interact with one another. Academically there are still many problems for international students at our faculty. Up until now there wasn't even a possibility of electing international students into the student council.
In the same way as the faculty FaRaFIN has been struggling with this evolution. There has been some good intentioned work towards bettering the situation, yet still international students often don't feel represented or aided by FaRaFIN.
We aim to change this and transform our faculty into a truly inclusive and multicultural place.
