## Integration of Local and International students

Some years ago the study courses DKE and DE have become very popular with international students. This is also heavily due to the fact that those courses are offered in english language.
Today we see many problems assoiciated with the faculties utter unpreparedness in regards to having international students. There has been some good work, but there's still a long way to go.
Last semester the percentage of international students in our faculty was over 37% (593 students), while for the current summer term there are 343 international students applying for a course.
Of course not all of the international students are non-german-speaking - but visibly a big part of the faculty consists of such students. When we refer to "international" students in later instances of this document, we generally adress those students, who came here to absolve their studies in english language.
These students are seperated from german-speaking students in many ways. On a social level we observe two nearly completly seperate groups of students which don't really interact with one another. Academely there are still many problems for international students at our faculty. Up until now there wasn't even a possibility of electing international students into student council.
In the same way as the faculty FaRaFIN has been struggling with this evolution. There has been some good intentioned work towards bettering the situation, yet still international students often don't feel represented or aided by FaRaFIN.
We aim to change this and transform our faculty into a truly inclusive and multicultural place.

## Anti discrimination work

- Different sides of discrimination
- Make this visible
- Create awareness for discriminatory behaviour
- Inclusiveness

## Opening up FaRaFIN for political work, in specific a clear position against climate change and fascism

In the year 2009 FaRaFIN has adopted a stance not to do political work, except for (in extreme cases) academic policies.
Not only does this mean FaRaFIN won't do any projects which could be deemed political in any way (which is difficult if you consider everything to be in some way political) - but it also doesn't fund or advertise anything in that regard.
Lately this rule has loosened a bit, but, as demonstrated by the refusal to advertise an event on free social media, this is more due to not having questioned if a event is political or not.

- Fridays for future as a student initiative
- Importance of climate change
- Digital policies
- Active tolerance
- International students

## Promote ethical thinking amongst our students

- Computer scientists as the job of the future
- Ethical responsibility
- Military, repression, censorship, privacy etc

## Fundamental reform and opening of FaRaFIN a more productive and open culture in FaRaFIN

- Decision-making
- Bureaucracy
- Describe toxic culture

## Why are we doing this?

So you may ask yourself, why we aren't just joining FaRaFIN the "traditional" way. We chose to do so, because with the years the work in this council has become more and more stuck and we don't believe that it is possible to fix this system from inside (some of us having tried and failed at this in the past).

Traditionally the election for this council has been more or less meaningless, because only one list was present. Thus, the main relevant point of the elections, was who would be able to run for speaker of finances - but even if the chosen person didn't make the "first seven", enough people stepped down until that person was amongst those.

With the election being meaningless, there was never any ambition to do a meaningful election campaign - campaigning for oneself was also one thing frowned upon by the "one list". Thus most students were never really enabled to know who stands for what and who they should vote for.

In running with a second list we force a change in this. We have written a program with points we as a list have committed ourselves to work for.
