### Integration of Local and International students

Some years ago the study courses DKE and DE have become very popular with international students. This is also heavily due to the fact that those courses are offered in English language. <br />
Today we see many problems associated with the faculties utter unpreparedness in regards to having international students. There has been some good work, but there's still a long way to go.  <br /> 
Last semester the percentage of international students in our faculty was over 37% (593 students), while for the current summer term there are 343 international students applying for a course.  <br /> 
Of course not all of the international students are non-german-speaking - but visibly a big part of the faculty consists of such students. When we refer to "international" students in later instances of this document, we generally address those students, who came here to absolve their studies in the English language. <br /> 
These students are separated from german-speaking students in many ways. On a social level we observe two nearly completely separate groups of students which don't really interact with one another. Academically there are still many problems for international students at our faculty. Up until now there wasn't even a possibility of electing international students into the student council. <br /> 
In the same way as the faculty FaRaFIN has been struggling with this evolution. There has been some good intentioned work towards bettering the situation, yet still international students often don't feel represented or aided by FaRaFIN. <br /> 
We aim to change this and transform our faculty into a truly inclusive and multicultural place.

### Anti discrimination work

We want to highlight and focus different sides of discrimination. In making discriminative behaviour visible we want to create awareness among people. In our opinion this is the first step to better inclusiveness. <br /> 
With this goal in mind members of our group have founded FaRaFINs awareness group this January and are currently in the process of building this group.

### Opening up FaRaFIN for political work

In the year 2009 FaRaFIN has adopted a stance not to do political work, except for (in extreme cases) academic policies.  <br /> 
Not only does this mean FaRaFIN won't do any projects which could be deemed political in any way (which is difficult if you consider everything to be in some way political) - but it also doesn't fund or advertise anything in that regard.  <br /> 
Lately this rule has loosened a bit, but, as demonstrated by the refusal to advertise an event on free social media, this is more due to not having questioned if a event is political or not.  <br /> 
These days we have to face a lot of important political topics which can have a huge impact on our lives today and in the future. Currently there are Students demonstrating each Friday for the sake of our climate at the Fridays for future demonstartions. We want to support this cause as a student council. <br /> 
Again and again right-wing and racist demonstrations are called for. Especially with regard to our international fellow students, we want to stand up for tolerance and openness to the world. Therefore we want to take a very clear stand against racism and discrimination.  <br /> 
Especially for computer science students internet policy is very interesting since we are often regarded as experts for digital topics. With regard to topics like the discussion about article 13 (and others) we want to inform and position ourselves more. 

### Promote ethical thinking amongst our students

- Computer scientists as the job of the future
- Ethical responsibility
- Think about applications like military, repression, censorship, privacy etc

### Improve the study situation of all students
- more open labs
- improve registration for courses
- improve exam schedules
- improve CV masters course
- improve CV in non-medical fields

### Fundamental reform and opening of FaRaFIN 

- we want a more productive and open culture in FaRaFIN
- Open and transparent decision-making 
- reduce bureaucracy
- remove toxic culture in favor of a productive and open one
