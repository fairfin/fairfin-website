We're FAIRfin - a diverse group of students wanting to make a difference at our university. In this years commission elections we want to run for FIN's student council as well as the universities student council (the latter in cooperation with the GHG (green university group). 

At the moment all of us are experienced in doing voluntary work besides our studies, be it in student council, Acagamics or with the international mentors. If you are interested in who we are as persons, feel free to read our [personal introductions](/introductions). 

We have defined six main foci for our work (mainly aimed at the FIN): 
- integration of local and international students
- anti-discrimination work
- opening up FaRaFIN for political work, in specific a clear position against climate change and fascism
- promote ethical thinking amongst our students
- improve the study situation of all students
- fundamental reform and opening of FaRaFIN towards a more productive and open culture
We have explained each of them in more depth [here](/focus).

If you're interested in more details we invite you to read our [program](/program)! 

We're still searching for members to run for both student councils, so if you agree with our program and want to help improve the life of our students feel free to contact us at contact@fairfin.org - briefly describing your motivation. You can read more about becoming a member [here](join-us).
