Of course we're still searching for likeminded people willing to join us. On this page we want to try to give you a broad overview of what that would mean. If you have any questions, please feel free to write us an e-mail to contact@fairfin.org. 

First of all please read our page on the [focus](/focus) of this group. If you agree with those points in principle you can read up our [program](/program), though that's a work in progress and you can still add to it.  

As an elected member of one of the student councils you should be able to attend the meetings. FaRaFIN's meeting time changes per semester and legislation. But they usually meet every two weeks in the semester and every three weeks outside of the semester. StuRa always meets on Thursdays 7pm (in the semester every two weeks, outside of the semester usually every three weeks).

It would also be nice if you could hold a consultation-hour during the semester, so that students continue to have an easily accessible contact point. 

There are also many appointments and departments in FaRaFIN, where you could participate and outside of that many projects which are always in need of organisation. 

If you're interested in joining us, please write us an e-mail to contact@fairfin.org with a short introduction and motivation and we'll then invite you to a meeting. We'll then decide (unanimously) if you're a good fit for our list.
