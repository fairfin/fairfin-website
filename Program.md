This is our program for FaRaFIN in the upcoming 2019 committee elections. We have sorted points into five categories: Studies, Faculty, University and Society, Projects and Events, internal structure of FaRaFIN.

## Studies

#### English Courses

This semester we are closing in on having **50%** international students in our faculty. Yet only about **7 of our 20** profs even offer english courses **(and even then not all of their courses are offered in english language)**.
Those few courses which are offered in english language then naturally get overrun resulting in students not being able to take them. For many students this results in having to study an additional year and not having the ability to choose between different courses.
This is just one example of the universities recless behaviour in implementing two english study courses and not preparing for them in any way.

* We want to promote using a central technical system for registering to a specific course
* We want to draft up a fair, discrimination free system of letting people into their preferred courses

#### Ethics course

* point out ethic courses in other areas
* responsibility of computer scientists
* current situation (“two” courses)
* something like Schlueko
* more (and required) ethics courses
* measures
** bring this up in StuKo and faculty council
** assist in drafting a possible module description and redesign the courses to reflect this course
** look into getting more (external) courses in this direction

#### Computer Visualistics Masters program

More and more students decide for the computer science master program instead of a computational visualistics master program. That is because the computational visualistics master has no advantage over a computer science master. In fact you can do more typical computational visualistics courses when choosing the computer science master since in the computational visualistics programm you get forced to choose some lectures, that are not related to computational visualistics. Also in the computational visualistics program you don’t have the chance to go on with your “Anwendungsfach” (except for some medicine lectures), but as a computer science master student you could just choose those courses as “Nebenfach”.
Currently there is no benefit from choosing the computational visualistics master program instead of the computer science master program.

#### Computer Visualistics outside of the medical focus

In the computational visualistics bachelor program you have to choose one out of five “Anwendungsfächer”. These are “Medizintechnik”, “Computer Spiele”, “Konstruktion und Design”, “Bildinformationstechnik”, “Werkstoffwissenschaften” and “Biologie”. Computational visualistics is officially advertised as an interdisciplinary study course, but the conntection beween your studies at the FIN and your “Anwendungsfach” is sometimes very weak. How much you can include your chosen “Anwendungsfach” in your studies (beyond the four mandatory courses) depends on the research focus of our professors. Since many Professors at our faculty are interested in medicine, you have the possibility to choose many different courses and seminars or even a thesis related to the “Anwendungsfach” “Medztintechnik”. Some of the other “Anwendungsfächer”, especially “Konstruktion und Design”, do not have this possibilites.

#### Exam scheduling

* try improving the exam scheduling
** examinations should be better spread over the whole examination phase
** it should not be the case that a large part of the examinations take place at the beginning of the examination phase

#### Recognize profile study courses for non-cs students

*open to discussion*

* currently only the cs-study course has profile courses
* if you’re studying business informatics (eg.) and do all courses part of such a profile, that isn’t officially recognized

##### flatten hierarchies in FaRaFIN

Currently FaRaFIN consists of seven members + their deputies. Out of these a board consisting of three speakers gets elected. These speakers have some authority on matters in FaRaFIN and a small budget. Each speaker is also responsible for a bunch of tasks falling into their area, although there is no formal definition which tasks these are exactly.
Especially in the past legislation this has ben cause for some problems. As there are different opinions on how much authority the board should have there have been instances of the board having been task to solve some matters by FaRaFIN and later being reproached for actually doing that.
Furthermore it has become more and more difficult to find people willing to take the speaker positions, as it is unclear how much work actually comes with the position.
We believe all seven members of FaRaFIN should be equal and that no additional hierarchy is necessary above them. Thus we want to promote the following points:

* remove the term “board” from FaRaFINs bylaws and replace it with “speakers”
** that way no hierarchy is implied
* remove the boards budget + resolution and any further special authorities the board has. At the same time we want to make it easier for the members to make quick decisions if necessary, as to not disable FaRaFIN if some small amount of money needs to be spent.
* Make the sole purpose of the speaker of finances to be FaRaFINs accountant
* Make the sole purpose of the speaker for internal affairs do to be a mediator and contact person for FaRaFINs internal affairs
* Make the sole purpose of the speaker of public affairs to be a contact person for external entities
