Here you can see who the people making up our list are. 

### Claudius Grimm (he)
*running for: FaRaFIN and StuRa*

Hi, Iâ€™m Claudius and currently pursuing a masters degree in computer science. I completed my bachelors degree in computational visualistics before that. <br />
I started to do volunteer work when I enrolled at FIN, mostly with the student game developer club Acagamics. The high amount of unnecessary bureaucracy and sticking to, from my point of view, unnecessary regulations kept me from joining the FaRaFin. Especially this point I want to change and try to make the FaRa more inviting for all students. Additionally I want to promote political activism and ethical thinking among the students.

### David Magnus Henriques (he/they)
*running for: FaRaFIN and StuRa*

Hey, I'm David - currently studying computer science. I'm doing voluntary work besides my studies since nearly four years now. That startet at Acagamics, where I was a member of the board for two years and has begun to shift in direction of FaRaFIN for three years now. <br /> 
With the years my focus has shifted from just wanting to organize cool events (which I do still enjoy), to wanting to improve the conditions of everyone studying here. <br />
For next legislation I'd like to continue working against discrimination and for more diversity with the newly founded Awareness Group. Here I'll be continuing my focus on integrating local and international students, as I see the current situation as very shameful for our university. <br /> 
In addition to this I also want to promote ethical thinking and political activism amongst our students, because I view this as extremly important in our field of work. 

### Gustav Neumann 
*running for: FaRaFIN*

Gustav hasn't been able to write their introduction-text yet, it will go up here as soon as possible.

### muffin (no pronoun)
*running for: FaRaFIN and StuRa*

Hello, I am muffin! I'm part of our faculty's student council since I started studying in 2015. In the beginning I just helped a little bit. Since last year I am the apointee for bachelor mentoring and I am one of the founders of the awareness group. <br />
I want to work towards more tolerance and acceptance in our faculty and a better togetherness.

### Naveen Raj Datha 
*running for: FaRaFIN*

Hello, I am Naveen. I am studying Masters in Digital Engineering at FIN. I have been actively involved with the International student mentoring program at FIN since 2017. At the mentoring program, I assist the International students in integrating with the German education system and culture. <br />
At FAIRfin, I'd like to work towards bringing in an approachable and friendly platform for the International students to address their concerns, to make their voice heard.

### Sarah Mittenentzwei (she)
*running for: FaRaFIN*

I am Sarah, since the winter semester 2015/16 I have been studying computational visualistics at FIN, starting with my master's degree this semester. In the last few years I have been active mainly at Acagamics and have also worked as a helper, mentor and tutor at various events. During my studies I noticed a lot of things that I would like to change and improve concerning the (CV) studies and the FIN in general. It is particularly important to me to improve the relationship between international and German students and to create a better platform for (internet)policy issues at our faculty. Apart from these points I would also like to make a general effort to improve the study conditions.

### Sascha Moros (they/she)
*running for: FaRaFIN*

Hi, I am Sascha and I study CV since 2015. Starting with my first Semester I was active in Acagamics, where I organized events, courses and workshops. <br />
Owing to our current political situation though, I find it increasingly necessary to use the platforms given to us as students politically. As part of the Awareness Group, this means fighting against daily and structural discrimination among a diverse student body. Furthermore though, it has to mean politically positioning the FaraFIN against oppressive structures and movements and to encourage and foster political activism among the students. 

### Sumit Kundu 
*running for: FaRaFIN*

Sumit hasn't been able to write their introduction-text yet, it will go up here as soon as possible.

### Tharakeswara Rao
*running for: FaRaFIN*

Hi, this is Tharakeswara Rao currently I am studying masters degree in Digital Engineering. I joined the International mentoring program at the faculty of informatics to help international students facing difficulties in course studies and integrating with the german culture. Also I am part of the Awareness group working against discrimination in the university. If you have any concerns related to discrimination, sexual harassment and violence please contact us.
